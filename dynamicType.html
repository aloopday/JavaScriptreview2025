        <p>JavaScript has dynamic types. This means that the same variable can be used to 
            hold different data types:
        </p>
        <p id="demo"></p>
        <script>
            let x; //Now x is a undefined
             x=5; // Now x is a number
             x="John"; // now x is a string.

             document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML=x;

        </script>
